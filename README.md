Package [clerk](https://godoc.org/github.com/arthurwhite/clerk) provides file persistence for your Go variables.

It can replace external databases for small projects that can keep data in memory and don't do a lot of writes.

## Installing

1. Get package:

	```Shell
	go get -u github.com/arthurwhite/clerk
	```

2. Import it in your code:

	```Go
	import "github.com/arthurwhite/clerk"
	```

## Usage

Make a new database with a source and a destination file name:

```Go
var data interface{}

db, err := clerk.New("data.gob", &data)
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

After a data change, use [DB.Save](https://godoc.org/github.com/arthurwhite/clerk#DB.Save) to encode the source with [gob](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/gob/) and save it in the destination file:

```Go
data = "one"
if err = data.Save(); err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

On restart, the data file will be decoded back in the source variable.

If the data must be accessed by multiple goroutines; don't forget to use [sync.Mutex](https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#Mutex) or [sync.RWMutex](https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#RWMutex).
